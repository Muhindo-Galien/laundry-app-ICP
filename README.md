# Laundry App ICP

## ✨Overview
This smart contract implements a laundry business system on Internet Computer using Azle (Typescript CDK). The system allows customer to create, update, and cancel laundry transaction. The laundry owner can work based on the transaction and get paid for it.

## 🔍Prerequisites
- Node
- Typescript
- DFX
- IC CDK

## 📘How To Use
First, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ninoaddict/laundry-app-ICP
```

`dfx` is the tool you will use to interact with the IC locally and on mainnet. If you don't already have it installed:

```bash
npm run dfx_install
```

Next you will want to start a replica, which is a local instance of the IC that you can deploy your canisters to:

```bash
npm run replica_start
```

If you ever want to stop the replica:

```bash
npm run replica_stop
```

Now you can deploy your canister locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run canister_deploy_local
```

Assuming you have [created a cycles wallet](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/network-quickstart) and funded it with cycles, you can deploy to mainnet like this:

```bash
npm run canister_deploy_mainnet
```
